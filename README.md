# Dragons of Mugloar

A simple **Spring Boot** web application designed to test some API of the game ***Dragons of Mugloar***.

The UI is basically worked with **Thymeleaf** templates to reduce involving frontend technologies like **Angular** preventing further complexities.

The main focus of this project is on the backend side and how to communicate with **REST APIs** of the game.

**Swagger** is used for API documentation. 

**JUnit**/**Mockito**/**MockMVC**/**AssertJ** and **Hamcrest** are technologies used for doing the tests.

For reducing boiler plate code I have used **Project Lombok** dependency.
